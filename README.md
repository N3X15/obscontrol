# OBSControl

A mod for controlling OBS Studio from inside VRChat.\
somewhat ported from a [beat saber mod](https://github.com/Zingabopp/OBSControl) version

## typical disclaimer yada yada
Mods are against VRChat TOS. However, this mod does nothing to make you different from other users\
**If you are afraid of a very unlikely ban risk then I recommend you do not proceed.**
